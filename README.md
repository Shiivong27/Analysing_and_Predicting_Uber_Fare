# Analysing_and_Predicting_Uber_Fare
Here, our task is to analyze and predict Uber fare data. There are many small tasks that are needed to be done before moving on to analysing and predicting on the Uber data such as data cleaning, data imputing and data prediction.

I've used Linear Rwgression for prediction and I am getting around 97% accuracy on average (yeah, I checked for overfitting!) on my model. Goes to show that sometimes the easiest of approaches can have the best rewards.

Python packages used :

- pandas
- numpy
